function [MMAP,PHs] = mmap_mixture_fit_mmap(mmap)
% Fits a MMAP with m classes using a mixture of m^2 PH-distributions.
% Each PH distribution represents the probability distribution conditioned
% on the fact that the last arrival was of class i and the next arrival is
% of class j.

% INPUT
% - mmap: the MMAP to fit
% OUTPUT
% - MMAP: the fitted MMAP
% - PHs: the fitted PH-distributions for each transition

% compute two-step transition probabilities
