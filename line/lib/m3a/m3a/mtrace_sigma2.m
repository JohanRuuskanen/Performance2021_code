function sigma = mtrace_sigma2(T,L)
% Computes the empirical probability of observing a specific 3-element
% sequence of events, i.e. the two-step class transition probabilities.
% Input:
%   T: the inter-arrival times
%   L: the event labels
% Output:
%   sigma: the matrix whose (i,j) element is the probability of observing
%   an event of class i followed by an event of class j.
