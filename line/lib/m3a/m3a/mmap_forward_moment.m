function MOMENTS = mmap_forward_moment(MMAP,ORDERS,NORM)
% Computes the theoretical forward moments of an MMAP.
% Input:
% - MMAP:   the MMAP
% - ORDERS: vector with the orders of the moments to compute
% - NORM:   0 to return F_{i,c}: M_i = sum F_{i,c}
%           1 (default) to return F_{i,c}: M_i = sum F_{i,c} * p_c
%           where
%             M_i is the class independent moment of order i
%             F_{i,c} is the class-c forward moment of order i
%             p_c is the probability of arrivals of class c
% Output:
% - MOMENTS: the forward moments as a matrix F(c,i) = F_{i,c}

% by default moments are normalized
