function MMAP = mamap2m_fit_gamma_fb_mmap(mmap)
% Performs approximate fitting of an MMAP[m], yielding a second-order
% acyclic MMAP[m] that matches the class probabilities, the forward and
% backward moments.
%
% Input
% - mmap: the MMAP[m] to fit
% Output
% - MMAP: fitted second-order MAMAP[m]
