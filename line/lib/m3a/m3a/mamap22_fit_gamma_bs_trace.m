function mmap = mamap22_fit_gamma_bs_trace(T, A)
% Performs approximate fitting of a marked trace with two classes, yielding
% a second-order acyclic MMAP[2] that fits the backward moments and the
% class transition probabilities.
%
% Input
% - T: the inter-arrival times
% - C: the class marks of each job
% Output
% - mmap: fitted MAMAP[m]
