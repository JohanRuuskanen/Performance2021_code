function MMAP = mamap2m_fit_gamma_fb_trace(T, A)
% Performs approximate fitting of a marked trace, yielding a second-order
% acyclic MMAP that matches the class probabilities, the forward and
% backward moments.
%
% Input
% - T: the inter-arrival times
% - A: the class marks of each job
% Output
% - MMAP: fitted MAMAP[m]
