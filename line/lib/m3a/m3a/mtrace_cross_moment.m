function MC = mtrace_cross_moment(T,L,k)
% Computes the k-th order moment of the inter-arrival time between an event
% of class i and an event of class j, for all possible pairs of classes.
% Input
%   T: inter-arrival times
%   L: class labels
%   k: order of the moment
% Output
%   MC: the element in (i,j) is the k-th order moment of the inter-arrival
%       time between an event of class i and an event of class j
