function MMAP = mmap_mixture(PHs, P2)
% Fits a MMAP with m classes using a mixture of m^2 PH-distributions.
% PH{i,j} represents the IAT distribution conditioned
% on the fact that the last arrival was of class i and the next arrival is
% of class j. Currently, the PH distributions are of the second order,
% hence the cross moments of order 1, 2 and 3 are required.
%
% INPUT
% - PHs: PH distributions
% - P2: two-step class transition probabilities
% OUTPUT
% - MMAP: the fitted MMAP
% - PHs: the fitted PH-distributions for each transition
