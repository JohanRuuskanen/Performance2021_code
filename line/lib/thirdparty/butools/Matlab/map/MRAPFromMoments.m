%  H = MRAPFromMoments(moms, Nm)
%  
%  Creates a marked rational arrival process that has the same 
%  marginal and lag-1 joint moments as given (see [1]_).
%  
%  Parameters
%  ----------
%  moms : vector of doubles
%      The list of marginal moments. To obtain a marked 
%      rational process of order M, 2*M-1 marginal moments
%      are required.
%  Nm : list of matrices, shape (M,M)
%      The list of lag-1 joint moment matrices. The 
%      length of the list determines K, the number of arrival 
%      types of the rational process.
%  
%  Returns
%  -------
%  H : list of matrices, shape (M,M)
%      The H0, H1, ..., HK matrices of the marked rational 
%      process
%  
%  Notes
%  -----
%  There is no guarantee that the returned matrices define
%  a valid stochastic process. The joint densities may be
%  negative.
