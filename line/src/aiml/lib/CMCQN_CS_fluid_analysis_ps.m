function [ode_h,ode_rates_h,ode_jumps_h,q_indices] = CMCQN_CS_fluid_analysis_ps(N, Mu, Phi, P, S)
% CMCQN_CS_FLUID_ANALYSIS_PS provides the methods to perform the ODE 
% analysis of a Closed Multi-Class Queueing Network with Class Switching
% with Coxian Service Times (CMCQNCSCox). 
% More details on this type of queueing networks can be found 
% on the LINE documentation, available at http://code.google.com/p/line
%
% Parameters:
% N:    total number of jobs
% Mu:   service rates in each station (in each phase), for each stage
% Phi:  probability of service completion in each stage of the service 
%       process in each station, for each stage
% P:    routing matrix for each stage
% S:    number of servers in each station, for each stage
%
% Output:
% ode_h:        handler of the ODE system
% q_indices:    indices of each job class and station, in the state vector
% ode_jumps_h:  handler of the jumps in the ODE system
% ode_rates_h:  handler of the transition rates in the ODE system
